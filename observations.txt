My first observation is that have a button that will 
pop out the modal is quit difficult trying to create 
because the focus of the box will be lost if the focus 
is directed to the learn more button. To solve this issue

I develop an alternative method to put the button outside the
focus to allow it to be clickable.

Using gulp to minify js and scss may not be the best because
some gulp scripts and modules are being abandoned and depreciated


I spent 78 hours in total developing this project.

Overall it being a nice challenge thanks.
